# SpeechT5 TTS Fine-Tuning for Hindi Language

This repository contains the code, models, and documentation for fine-tuning Microsoftâ€™s SpeechT5 model for Text-to-Speech (TTS) synthesis in Hindi. The primary goal of this project is to generate natural and accurate speech in Hindi, overcoming common challenges in TTS such as intonation, stress, and pronunciation of complex Hindi words.
### Overview

Hindi is a morphologically rich language, and existing TTS systems often struggle with pronunciation accuracy, especially for loanwords, dialect-specific phrases, and multi-syllabic constructs. This project leverages SpeechT5 and fine-tunes it on curated Hindi datasets to generate natural, fluent, and expressive speech.
